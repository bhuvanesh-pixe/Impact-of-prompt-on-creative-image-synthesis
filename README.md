# Impact-of-prompt-on-creative-image-synthesis

The intersection of artificial intelligence and creative image generation has witnessed remarkable advancements with the development of models such as DALL-E, CLIP, and more recently, stable diffusion models. This research project explores how prompts can affect the way images are generated, with a particular emphasis on these models. These models produce visuals that match the written descriptions given as input prompts. The study examines the effects of various input prompts on the properties, aesthetics, and content of the created images. Methodologically, studies are carried  out to examine the output pictures with different input prompts.

## Running the Code on Google Colab

You can run the code in this repository using Google Colab, a free cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment provided by Google.
### Steps:

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) in your web browser.
2. Upload the `code.ipynb` file from this repository to Google Colab. Alternatively, you can directly link to the notebook from GitHub by clicking on "File" > "Open notebook" > "GitHub" and pasting the URL of this repository.
3. Execute the code cells in the notebook by clicking on them and pressing `Shift + Enter`.

## Accessing Datasets
First, download the zip files in the `Dataset` folder, unzip them and upload them to Google Drive.
1. Click on the folder icon in the left sidebar of Google Colab.
2. Click on "Upload" and select the `Dataset` files namely `farmers market.webp` and `roman market.webp`.
3. Once uploaded, you can access the dataset files using their paths within the notebook.
